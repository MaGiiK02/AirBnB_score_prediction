TOTALLY, TOTALLY, TOTALLY recommend Daniel's place next time you visit Amsterdam.\", 'No amount of praise for Daniel would be corny or excessive.  His place was comfortable and wonderful, and he is an incredibly friendly and accommodating host.  I felt cleaner, safer, and happier than at any hotel.  A friend and I stayed here, and we loved having the twin beds in the same room.  The shower was luxurious and clean, and Daniel provided us with maps, restaurant recommendations, bikes, and tea service!  I just asked my travel companion \"What else can I say about Daniel\\'s place?\" and he was like, \"OH MAN!  It\\'s one thing to expect breakfast from a B&B, and it\\'s quite another to be chez Daniel.  His command of the nuances of hosting are unmatched.\"', \"It's the perfect place: clean, safe, noiseless, with a perfect owner.

', \"Our stay with Daniel was truly one of the highlights of mine and my partner's whirlwind European tour. Not only was the room smashingly decorated (a great example of modern Dutch living), spotlessly clean and serenely comfortable {think Zen), but having Daniel as a point of reference was our key to discovering the city. From the get-go he freely offered advice whenever we had questions about where to go or what to do in Amsterdam. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The room is located at quite a distance from the heart of the city, but we didn't find this hindering. We were able to get to the center in a snap with the two bikes Daniel has available for a minimal charge or via any of the train or bus stops located within a stones throw of his front door. There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and groceries in the area. And staying here is also a great way to see how the locals are living.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I would recommend Daniel's residence to anyone looking for a smart, affordable alternative to hotels or hostels. As a gay couple especially we found him extremely welcoming. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>P.S. You can check my YouTube page for videos of our stay in Amsterdam, which includes a peek into the room: http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=justjoshfunk1\", 'Daniel was very accomodating and friendly. It was a little pricey for what it was. The bed was smaller than a dormitory bed, and as a college student, I would know. The neighborhood seemed relatively safe but I did get hassled a few times outside of the apartment. Overall, I was impressed but I probably would stay closer to the city center in the future.', \"Daniel's place was great! We got so much relaxing in. We loved staying there are really appreciated his great hospitality! He gave us great tips on getting around etc. I would recommend his place to anyone traveling to Amsterdam.\", 'Just a short note - my first experience with AirBnB was with Daniel and it was stellar.  Exactly as indicated and advertised, the service was exemplary.  As a person who does a lot of business travelling, I found Daniel to be an informed and professional host.  Much better service than harried business travellers normally recieve.  For example he answered many questions about the local transportation, the scene, and the best way to spend our time.  He also arranged for bikes which is undoubtedly the best way to see the city.  I highly recommend Daniel to anyone considering a trip to Amsterdam, the experience was completely positive.', 'Daniel was an exceptional host!  I was primarily happy because of the following 3 characteristics:\\r<br/>\\r<br/>1) Friendliness and knowledgeability of the host -- Along with my reservation I received very carefully laid out instructions to arrive at Daniel\\'s doorstep and he was right there waiting for me when and where he said he would be.  One evening Daniel invited me to drink a beer with him and he shared his personal story about arriving in Amsterdam years ago and what attracted him to the city.  We also spent time talking about the culture of Holland and how its position as a trading port influenced the ideals of the city.  Daniel had good recommendations for how and when to see various tourist spots and had some alternative recommendations (local pools, bibliotech (library), etc...).\\r<br/>\\r<br/>2) Cleanliness of the place -- Daniel\\'s apartment is spotless.  The particular room was very well cared-for and had all of the accessories needed.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>3) All the \"little extras\" -- Daniel opened a fresh pair of slippers for me upon arrival.  He also had a nicely laid out tea/coffee set in the room, 3 different tour books about Amsterdam which helped me plan my days, a plastic map which I could carry throughout the adventures, a bicycle available to rent, matching set of shampoo/conditioner/lotion in the bathroom, etc...  an adapter for my US plugs.  Everything was well thought-out and Daniel gave a lot of attention to make sure that the visit was superb.', \"Daniel is a great host. He is a very sweet and courteous person and he seems to truly enjoy hosting guests. His apartment is very tidy and clean and it's not often that you come across such a clean and well organized place (you would have to go 4 stars or higher!). He provides everything the guests could think of (or at least that I can think of): bikes, towels, shampoo, conditioner, shower cap, different maps, guides etc. and he will always be of service when information or recommendations are needed. Daniel is very easy to deal with and it was a pleasure to stay with him.\\r<br/>Thank you Daniel.\", \"We spent two nights at Daniel's and very much enjoyed it. Early on, he e-mailed very explicit directions on how to reach his home and upon reaching there, he had maps and travel guides handy and was available to answer any questions. The room was quiet, comfortable, and meticulous. His place is a bit out of the central area of Amsterdam, but is easily accessible by tram. It was also nice to be away from the crowds and in a local neighborhood. We would thoroughly recommend his place and would stay again when in the area!\", 'Daniel was an excellent host, and I whole heartedly recommend his accomodations. He is pleasant, the place was very clean, and the location was perfect - a 10-15 minute bus or metro ride to downtown and quiet in the evening. On my next visit to Amsterdam, I would absolutely stay with Daniel again. ', \"Daniel is a fantastic host who cares about the details of his guest's stay in Amsterdam. He was a blessing when it came to getting directions of where we needed to go. He definitely comes excellently-recommended!\", \"Daniel's setup was very good.  Like other reviewers have said before, he has a lot of nice little touches and everything is extremely well thought out in providing a seamless experience for his guests.  \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Daniel himself was really nice and accommodating.  He helped me figure out all my public transportation needs, weather predictions and requests.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>His place is clean and near lots of different tram lines, so you can get pretty much anywhere.  Also he seems to work around your schedule in terms of cleaning the room and letting you use the shower, etc.  So it's just really comfortable in that regard where you don't feel like you are imposing too much.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>There are also some food options around his apartment to grab some food late at night which is always handy.  Would definitely stay there agin.\", \"Our stay at Daniel was awesome. He has a beautiful flat which is very tidy and neat. The room to rent is also very nice. It has two comfy beds and a wardrobe. Daniel also provides a private kettel, a range of tea and coffee. There are also towels for which Daniel provides a special space in the bathroom. \\r<br/>What was outstanding, was that Daniel also lent us two of his bikes. This was most helpful as we hadn't to figure out the public transport and were free to discover Amsterdam by bike. Even if you would have to take the bus or tram the appartment is located idealy to various stops. \", \"my stay with Daniel was truly one of the highlights of of my visit to amsterdam.

It's particularly well-suited to the solo traveller and Daniel is a fantastic host. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Slightly outside the 'core' of Amsterdam, but transport is extremely convenient and Daniel is hugely accommodating with late-night schedules. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Only thing I'd say is that it is best if you have experienced what European apartments are actually like. Daniel's is really, really nice - but it IS European. If you're fresh off the plane from North America and have never been to Europe before I'd suggest you get a hotel for a few days first. But I'd say that about any European apartment. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Hugely enjoyed my time. Highly recommend.  \", \"Staying at Daniel's apartment was great!

He even allowed us to use his bikes free of charge! He was very accommodating and accepted our booking very last minute, and didn't mind that we were arriving late in the evening on a weeknight. The location of his apartment is also great--near both train and bus stops, in a nice, quiet neighborhood. I would absolutely recommend staying here! \", \"Daniel's apartment was perfect for my 5 days in Amsterdam (march 2011) and was a great value. It is only 5 minutes away from the bus and is in a safe residential area. The area has public transports, restaurants, laundry, supermarket. The apartment was also very comfortable and very well-equipped. The kitchen, work desk, shower and bathroom were all very nice. It is well maintained, very clean, nicely decorated. The bed is really comfortable, the sheets are soft and fragrant. There were beautiful flowers, tea and hot water inside my room. He has an eye for everything, is friendly and very professional. Daniel arranged everything and advised me before the trip. His manager went well beyond to answer my daily questions, taught me how travel around the city, and was nearby most times or quickly responded to my messages.  In short: go to Amsterdam, rent Daniel's appartment and be happy. Thanks again, Daniel for a great stay! Angela (Brazil).\", \"Great Trip, accomodation was very clean and Daniel was very welcoming and professional. He provides hotel-like accomodation with a real feeling of Amsterdam. Would highly recommend a stay at Daniel's. \", \"Daniel is an amazing host!  The room is exceptionally comfortable, very good mattresses, very pretty, light and airy.  There is a tea service area with a small fridge that was very convenient.  The environment was exceptionally clean, organized and Daniel has maps and a wealth of information available for tourists.  He was great at helping us to make arrangements for tourist tickets online.  The most wonderful thing about his location is the neighborhood, especially if you are looking for a local experience.  It was very easy to use the public transit system from his location.  Everything is close.  Daniel offered bikes to use and that was fabulous.  Daniel did everything possible to provide a pleasant experience and we had an amazing time.  I highly recommend Daniel's place.  \", 'We spent  a few day by Daniel. We have a very good accomotion. Daniel is very kind and busy man for his guest. We will come back to Amsterdam and defently go to Daniel. ', \"Daniel is a welcoming and accommodating host who is interesting to talk with.

I will definitely stay with Daniel again and I have already recommended his room to family and friends.', 'Daniel is an outstanding host. He is extraordinarily organized & tidy. The room was spotless, and the two beds were comfortable. There is quite a lot of space, and a beautiful view of his backyard garden out the bedroom window.

Highly recommended! I would definitely stay again.', 'Daniels\\'s place is really fantastic and he was a great host! \\r<br/>\\r<br/>His place is beautifully decorated and very clean and no detail is lost to the make the stay very comfortable for his guests.

Highly recommended!\", 'Daniel was the definition of a fantastic host. His place was impeccable. When we arrived (which was late, and our ETA was changed a few times due to travel woes), our beds were made, clean towels neatly wrapped, soothing music playing, and the smell of fresh eucalyptus/mint filled the air.

This was our first time staying in a B&B and let's just say he set the bar really high. His home was extremely clean and very well organized. The garden view was so peaceful. Both my bf and myself were sick during our Europe trip and Daniel was kind enough to offer us lozenges for our sore throats. He was also very helpful by providing maps, magazines on things to do and any other advice we needed. The room came equipped with coffee and tea and WiFi. His home is very close to public transportation and getting to central Amsterdam was a breeze. If I ever come back to Amsterdam I would definitely be staying at his place again. \", \"I have nothing but praise for this gem of a place. Daniel is an exceptional host- he helped us carry our luggage, poured us juice, and gave us so many useful information that made our stay in Amsterdam truly memorable.

It was cozy, clean, and quiet.  Daniel was very helpful in giving directions on how to best get to his place with a bit of luggage.  On getting there he gave me directions on how best to get to do what I wanted in the time I had.  He provided privacy though I knew he was there to provide any help he could if needed.  I would recommend his place to my friends.  His place is in a very convenient and safe area.  I would definitely look into his place if I had another chance to go to Amsterdam. Thanks, Daniel.\", 'Wonderful, quiet and relaxing is the best way to describe Daniels apartment. Plus, Daniel was very accommodating and extremely helpful with directions. I would recommend Daniels apartment to anyone that is looking for a relaxing environment while visiting Amsterdam. ', 'The reservation was canceled 29 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.', \"We were very well received and his place was very clean. He's kind and wants you to feel at home. Our only complaint was that we were not made aware of the early morning check out time upon arrival and came home the night before to a note on the door asking us to be out by a certain time. As long as you get all the information and communication from him, you should be fine.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>\", 'My friend and I really enjoyed our stay in Amsterdam - Daniel is so friendly  and hospitable - the greatest example of this was when we were returning to the central station, he rode his bike to give me my tiny earrings which were the only thing I forgot. He also made sure we had coffee and tea in the morning. ', \"To describe our stay at Daniel's place in two words: absolutely wonderfull. Not only is Daniel a kind and caring person, but also a very attentive host who kept everything spotless.

Every bit of required information was provided before arrival, and the apartment was very clean and organized. The room looks just like it does in the pictures - well lit and colorful. Only slight problem we faced was a space issue when opening up multiple suitcases in the same room, but we got used to it soon enough. The room also has a mini-refrigerator - which was of great convenience. The neighborhood this apartment is located in is also very nice. Overall, very comfortable stay!\", \"Daniel was a very kind and gracious host. Zeeberg is an interesting area that is a little rundown compared to other parts of Amsterdam but they're obviously working to improve it. Traveling to and from centraal was quick and easy, especially with Daniel's guidance on the transit system. Additionally, how Daniel handled wifi access and the keypads for the apartment was flawless and inventive. \", \"Daniel est très hospitalier.

Daniel est vraiment très aimable, prend soin que vous ayez tout a votre disposition (par exemple nous avons eu la chance d'avoir des vélos de prêts pour les 5 jours sur place ce qui nous a beaucoup simplifié les trajets). La chambre en soi est très mignone, avec, encore une fois, tout ce dont vous pourriez avoir besoin à votre disposition. L'endroit est calme, plaisant, et extrêmement bien tenu! Je recommande à tous ceux qui souhaitent visiter Amsterdam en paix (ou y faire la fête) ce super logement!\", 'Daniel is a a very organized and professional host. A lot of information is at the hands of the guest from the very start. Tons of leaflets, magazines and print-outs about things to do in Amsterdam (plus bus routes and timetables) can be found in the room and in the hall of the apartment. The house is extremely clean. There are bus and tram stops nearby, which make it easy to get around the city. I would not hesitate to recommend Daniel to other people that want to stay in Amsterdam.', \"Daniel is a great host, his place is immaculate and comfortable. Daniel provided my friend and I with all the information we needed and then some. I would recommend Daniel's place to friends and family, no complaints what so ever.\", 'Daniel is the good host!

His apartment is very quiet and impeccably clean; the bedroom is very nice, exaclty as in the photos (pillows and duvet are very good). Besides, there is a table and a small fridge. The shower (separate from the WC)  is also very good. The apartment is not in the center but you can easily reach it by bus, tram or metro. There are various restaurants, bars and cafés in the area - this is great because you get to know places where tourists usually do not go. \\r<br/>Daniel is a great host, he provided us with very useful info about transport and things to do in Ams. Our stay was great, we did not have any problem at all in the apartment. I am sure Daniel would provide any further assistance that we may have needed, he really thinks about every tiny thing a tourist may need during his/her stay in Amsterdam. I also wanted to thank him for finding the contact lenses we forgot in the bedroom! Definitely recommend! \", \"Un séjour remarquable !  Daniel est un hôte soucieux du bien- être des gens qu'ils accueillent.  Toujours disponible et fier de partager ses connaissances de sa ville pour faciliter notre séjour.

It was also very well decorated and Daniel is very friendly and helpful!', \"Daniel was an excellent host! He greeted my friend and I with open arms, and was a superb resource for us. The personal maps he gave us were so handy! He went above and beyond our expectations when he was able to arrange his schedule to accept my friend's late baggage while we were enjoying the city.  I would recommend Daniel's place to everyone ! It is so close to the city center and the place is incredibly clean and comfortable! I wish we were there longer and I hope to return some day! \", \"Not sure what else can be said about Daniel.  He is a true gentleman and was always ready with any answers (or bandaids) we needed!

If we ever make it back to Amsterdam I won't even bother looking for somewhere else to stay!\", 'My experience in amsterdam was brilliant. From daniels appartment i had close access to buses and/or trams, so getting to the city centre was easy. A simple 5 minute journey.  Daniel as a host was superb, very relaxed atmosphere in his home, and he provided us with lots of information including places to go/see. I recommend daniel as a host full heartedly.  Brilliant time. Til next time!', \"Daniel was a very helpful host. Upon arrival he was there to welcome us with cold drinks. He provided us with clear directions and maps of Amsterdam. He made it so easy to explore Amsterdam using public transport. He was always available and happy to answer question. He was friendly and talkative and interested in our days. He was very well organised and the apartment was as pictured and spotlessly clean. The bed were very comfortable. I bought some food without realising that guests don't have access to the kitchen (it is written in the room description), Daniel was very generous and still let me use his kitchen to cook my food. We had a little bit of trouble connecting to the internet in the bedroom (was strong in the lounge room) Daniel gave us a signal booster for the bedroom when we let him know. I would recommend staying with Daniel.\", \"After we arrived Daniel showed us the accommodations and offered us something to drink. We proceeded to talk for the better part of three hours. Daniel is one of the most agreeable and accommodating people I have stayed with through Airbnb. In his apartment are countless books about Amsterdam that one can leaf through. However, if you don't like to read, he can show you places to go and tell you about locales to visit that are not only interesting for tourists but for locals as well. He provides you with numerous maps, so you will never be wanting a reference if you happen to lose your way. It was a warm and informative welcome. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The accommodations were spectacular. There are ample nooks in which to store your baggage, so what at first appears to be a modestly-sized room for two people with luggage turns out to be rather spacious. The room is equipped with a water heater, instant coffee, and tea, so if the need for a morning pep-up settles upon you, it is right there in your room. Each bed is equipped with a reading lamp and the heater is placed nicely between the heads of the bed. We were never cold. The bathroom and toilet were kept impeccably clean and the towels were washed when we needed them. The orchids throughout the apartment were also very beautiful, and when we wanted some fresh air we needed only to open the window to the garden that is situated between the beds. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The location of the apartment should suit those who want quick access to the city center without the bustle and noise. If one wishes to go by foot, one can get to the many attractions old city in about 30-45 minutes, depending on how fast one walks. It is an enjoyable city to walk in: very flat, organized, neighborhood markets everyday, different languages and cultures always surrounding you. The apartment itself is in a primarily non-native-Dutch neighborhood, so you're exposed from the get-go to the nice mix of cultures that Amsterdam harbors. The area is quiet but active. Staying here, one also experiences the everyday life of Amsterdam and avoids an environment overly saturated with tourists. There is a school, many shops for locals, and a playground for children in the vicinity. Flevo Park is about a five-minute walk from the apartment, which is nice if you want to spend an afternoon among the storks, swans, and sandy soil upon which Amsterdam is rooted.  \\r<br/>\\r<br/>To the host himself: Daniel is helpful. He makes sure you are comfortable and is always open to questions and offering suggestions. He takes care of without meddling over you. You could talk to him not only about Amsterdam but many things: the art in his apartment, the furniture, films, etc. We had no complaints and were very happy to have stayed there. If you wish to visit Amsterdam but avoid the bustle, this is where you should stay.\", \"Daniel was a great host, very attentive and prudent. His appartement was just as shown in the photos, very homely and clean and it smelled very nice and fresh. Hence we really enjoyed staying with him. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>After booking he sent us a nice email with lots of information and responded quickly to our questions.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>When we arrived in Amsterdam, we got a phone call from Daniel making sure we found his place okay. He is a calm, very friendly person who is fluent in English. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Upon arriving in Niasstraat, Anna and I realised that we didn’t know his last name, so we were worried, if we’d find his doorbell. To our surprise, he put his first name on the doorbell which is smart and gives him the benefit of a little more anonymity. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>We were greeted by Daniel at the door who invited us in and offered us something to drink. We were sitting in his living room, which is decorated with African wooden figures, listening to the Pachelbel canon. \\r<br/>He gave us lots of valuable information, including various maps (public transport, of the neighborhood and whole city), aswell as bus and tram schedules. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>You could tell from every detail that Daniel handles his hosting very professionally: he has a door lock with a key code, which he individually changes for every guest. His WiFi passwort was also changed specifically for our stay. We were positively surprised! \\r<br/>For security reasons, he also installed an infrared webcam in his hallway, which is okay but he forgot to mention it.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>After that he gave us the tour of his appartement. It’s a cozy, very tidy place with a guest room looking at the garden.\\r<br/>There are two beds, on top of each layed two rolled-up towels. They were color-marked red and orange respectively, so we would not confuse them in the bathroom. Another smart detail. \\r<br/>The room had all the extras as described and seen in the photographs. Daniel cleaned the dishes for us after every time we made tea and also cleaned our waste basket every day. \\r<br/>WiFi reception was not the best in the bedroom (we used two Android smartphones). Enough for WhatsApp, but not enough for watching YouTube clips. A WiFi repeater in the room would be a good solution to this problem. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>After this he showed us the bathroom. I was amused by a small homo-erotic piece of art attached to the bathroom door. The bathroom, like the rest of the appartment, was very clean, with a nice shower, space for toiletries on the washing machine and color-marked towel bars. The toilet was not in the bathroom, but an own seperate room.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>We can highly recommend @Daniel's and if we'll be visting Amsterdam again we would try to stay with him again.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Hartstikke bedankt Daniel!\", \"Staying at Daniel's place was as enjoyable as one could imagine. He welcomed us very kindly, showed us around and offered cold drinks. Then he already provided us with useful pieces of information.\\r<br/>The room is absolutely cosy and offers everything one would need.

But with Daniel's advice we did manage to have some great time in Amsterdam. \", \"Daniel was a wonderful host and the room was just as described/pictured.  He was able to provide good recommendations for what to do and had available things that travels need but tend to forget.  We rented bikes (for a small additional daily fee) -- that were in great condition and included everything we needed to be able to lock them up and ride safely at night -- and we found them to be a great way to get to know Amsterdam quickly and efficiently.  The neighborhood is very nice and it's easy to get to the heart of Amsterdam by bus or bike.  Highly recommended.\", \"I had a really wonderful stay at Daniel's.

He had bikes for us to rent (13 euro first day, 7 euro each day after) and they were great!! We got to see the city as the locals do and biking was so much fun!! It's difficult to get used to if you don't bike everyday, but it was so much fun! And Daniel told us everything we needed to know about biking in he city! Daniel's home is a 10 minute bike ride into the city which is perfect for any tourist wanting to see the city and an average Dutch neighborhood!
