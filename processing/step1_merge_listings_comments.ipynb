For example he answered many questions about the local transportation, the scene, and the best way to spend our time.  He also arranged for bikes which is undoubtedly the best way to see the city.

One evening Daniel invited me to drink a beer with him and he shared his personal story about arriving in Amsterdam years ago and what attracted him to the city.  We also spent time talking about the culture of Holland and how its position as a trading port influenced the ideals of the city.  Daniel had good recommendations for how and when to see various tourist spots and had some alternative recommendations (local pools, bibliotech (library), etc...).\\r<br/>\\r<br/>2) Cleanliness of the place -- Daniel\\'s apartment is spotless.  The particular room was very well cared-for and had all of the accessories needed.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>3) All the \"little extras\" -- Daniel opened a fresh pair of slippers for me upon arrival.  He also had a nicely laid out tea/coffee set in the room, 3 different tour books about Amsterdam which helped me plan my days, a plastic map which I could carry throughout the adventures, a bicycle available to rent, matching set of shampoo/conditioner/lotion in the bathroom, etc...  an adapter for my US plugs.

He even allowed us to use his bikes free of charge! He was very accommodating and accepted our booking very last minute, and didn't mind that we were arriving late in the evening on a weeknight.

Our stay was great, we did not have any problem at all in the apartment.

Til next time!',\n",
       " \"Daniel was a very helpful host. Upon arrival he was there to welcome us with cold drinks. He provided us with clear directions and maps of Amsterdam. He made it so easy to explore Amsterdam using public transport. He was always available and happy to answer question. He was friendly and talkative and interested in our days. He was very well organised and the apartment was as pictured and spotlessly clean. The bed were very comfortable. I bought some food without realising that guests don't have access to the kitchen (it is written in the room description), Daniel was very generous and still let me use his kitchen to cook my food. We had a little bit of trouble connecting to the internet in the bedroom (was strong in the lounge room) Daniel gave us a signal booster for the bedroom when we let him know. I would recommend staying with Daniel.\",\n",
       " \"After we arrived Daniel showed us the accommodations and offered us something to drink. We proceeded to talk for the better part of three hours. Daniel is one of the most agreeable and accommodating people I have stayed with through Airbnb. In his apartment are countless books about Amsterdam that one can leaf through. However, if you don't like to read, he can show you places to go and tell you about locales to visit that are not only interesting for tourists but for locals as well. He provides you with numerous maps, so you will never be wanting a reference if you happen to lose your way. It was a warm and informative welcome. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The accommodations were spectacular. There are ample nooks in which to store your baggage, so what at first appears to be a modestly-sized room for two people with luggage turns out to be rather spacious. The room is equipped with a water heater, instant coffee, and tea, so if the need for a morning pep-up settles upon you, it is right there in your room. Each bed is equipped with a reading lamp and the heater is placed nicely between the heads of the bed. We were never cold. The bathroom and toilet were kept impeccably clean and the towels were washed when we needed them. The orchids throughout the apartment were also very beautiful, and when we wanted some fresh air we needed only to open the window to the garden that is situated between the beds. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The location of the apartment should suit those who want quick access to the city center without the bustle and noise. If one wishes to go by foot, one can get to the many attractions old city in about 30-45 minutes, depending on how fast one walks. It is an enjoyable city to walk in: very flat, organized, neighborhood markets everyday, different languages and cultures always surrounding you. The apartment itself is in a primarily non-native-Dutch neighborhood, so you're exposed from the get-go to the nice mix of cultures that Amsterdam harbors. The area is quiet but active. Staying here, one also experiences the everyday life of Amsterdam and avoids an environment overly saturated with tourists. There is a school, many shops for locals, and a playground for children in the vicinity. Flevo Park is about a five-minute walk from the apartment, which is nice if you want to spend an afternoon among the storks, swans, and sandy soil upon which Amsterdam is rooted.  \\r<br/>\\r<br/>To the host himself: Daniel is helpful. He makes sure you are comfortable and is always open to questions and offering suggestions. He takes care of without meddling over you. You could talk to him not only about Amsterdam but many things: the art in his apartment, the furniture, films, etc. We had no complaints and were very happy to have stayed there. If you wish to visit Amsterdam but avoid the bustle, this is where you should stay.\",\n",
       " \"Daniel was a great host, very attentive and prudent. His appartement was just as shown in the photos, very homely and clean and it smelled very nice and fresh. Hence we really enjoyed staying with him. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>After booking he sent us a nice email with lots of information and responded quickly to our questions.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>When we arrived in Amsterdam, we got a phone call from Daniel making sure we found his place okay. He is a calm, very friendly person who is fluent in English. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Upon arriving in Niasstraat, Anna and I realised that we didn’t know his last name, so we were worried, if we’d find his doorbell. To our surprise, he put his first name on the doorbell which is smart and gives him the benefit of a little more anonymity. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>We were greeted by Daniel at the door who invited us in and offered us something to drink. We were sitting in his living room, which is decorated with African wooden figures, listening to the Pachelbel canon. \\r<br/>He gave us lots of valuable information, including various maps (public transport, of the neighborhood and whole city), aswell as bus and tram schedules. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>You could tell from every detail that Daniel handles his hosting very professionally: he has a door lock with a key code, which he individually changes for every guest. His WiFi passwort was also changed specifically for our stay. We were positively surprised! \\r<br/>For security reasons, he also installed an infrared webcam in his hallway, which is okay but he forgot to mention it.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>After that he gave us the tour of his appartement. It’s a cozy, very tidy place with a guest room looking at the garden.\\r<br/>There are two beds, on top of each layed two rolled-up towels. They were color-marked red and orange respectively, so we would not confuse them in the bathroom. Another smart detail. \\r<br/>The room had all the extras as described and seen in the photographs. Daniel cleaned the dishes for us after every time we made tea and also cleaned our waste basket every day. \\r<br/>WiFi reception was not the best in the bedroom (we used two Android smartphones). Enough for WhatsApp, but not enough for watching YouTube clips. A WiFi repeater in the room would be a good solution to this problem. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>After this he showed us the bathroom. I was amused by a small homo-erotic piece of art attached to the bathroom door. The bathroom, like the rest of the appartment, was very clean, with a nice shower, space for toiletries on the washing machine and color-marked towel bars. The toilet was not in the bathroom, but an own seperate room.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>We can highly recommend @Daniel's and if we'll be visting Amsterdam again we would try to stay with him again.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Hartstikke bedankt Daniel!\",\n",

Serioysly now - we enjoyed his place a lot. The mattress of his bed is unbelievable - so confortable (I never trusted soft matresses- my back is very senstive). Riding a bike one can easily reach the central area within 20-30 min depending on your energy and wind factor. Thre is a nice park nearby (7 min). We had a fantastic spring wheather most if the time  (3/4 d) which obviously makes a difference. In two occasions we returned home at 1:15 am - it was safe and  fun.  If you are less lucky and must face cold  rain, the tram and bus are not too far, but you need a strong umbrella (Daniel will provide you if required). In summary - Enjoy his room because Amsterdam (with sun) is an urban paradise. Daniel is a privileged man...',\n",

The shower was luxurious and clean, and Daniel provided us with maps, restaurant recommendations, bikes, and tea service!  I just asked my travel companion \"What else can I say about Daniel\\'s place?\" and he was like, \"OH MAN!  It\\'s one thing to expect breakfast from a B&B, and it\\'s quite another to be chez Daniel.  His command of the nuances of hosting are unmatched.\"',\n",

Not only was the room smashingly decorated (a great example of modern Dutch living), spotlessly clean and serenely comfortable {think Zen), but having Daniel as a point of reference was our key to discovering the city. From the get-go he freely offered advice whenever we had questions about where to go or what to do in Amsterdam. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The room is located at quite a distance from the heart of the city, but we didn't find this hindering. We were able to get to the center in a snap with the two bikes Daniel has available for a minimal charge or via any of the train or bus stops located within a stones throw of his front door. There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and groceries in the area. And staying here is also a great way to see how the locals are living.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I would recommend Daniel's residence to anyone looking for a smart, affordable alternative to hotels or hostels. As a gay couple especially we found him extremely welcoming. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>P.S.

As a person who does a lot of business travelling, I found Daniel to be an informed and professional host.  Much better service than harried business travellers normally recieve.  For example he answered many questions about the local transportation, the scene, and the best way to spend our time.  He also arranged for bikes which is undoubtedly the best way to see the city.  I highly recommend Daniel to anyone considering a trip to Amsterdam, the experience was completely positive.',\n",
       " 'Daniel was an exceptional host!  I was primarily happy because of the following 3 characteristics:\\r<br/>\\r<br/>1) Friendliness and knowledgeability of the host -- Along with my reservation I received very carefully laid out instructions to arrive at Daniel\\'s doorstep and he was right there waiting for me when and where he said he would be.  One evening Daniel invited me to drink a beer with him and he shared his personal story about arriving in Amsterdam years ago and what attracted him to the city.  We also spent time talking about the culture of Holland and how its position as a trading port influenced the ideals of the city.  Daniel had good recommendations for how and when to see various tourist spots and had some alternative recommendations (local pools, bibliotech (library), etc...).\\r<br/>\\r<br/>2) Cleanliness of the place -- Daniel\\'s apartment is spotless.  The particular room was very well cared-for and had all of the accessories needed.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>3) All the \"little extras\" -- Daniel opened a fresh pair of slippers for me upon arrival.  He also had a nicely laid out tea/coffee set in the room, 3 different tour books about Amsterdam which helped me plan my days, a plastic map which I could carry throughout the adventures, a bicycle available to rent, matching set of shampoo/conditioner/lotion in the bathroom, etc...  an adapter for my US plugs.  Everything was well thought-out and Daniel gave a lot of attention to make sure that the visit was superb.',\n",

His apartment is very tidy and clean and it's not often that you come across such a clean and well organized place (you would have to go 4 stars or higher!). He provides everything the guests could think of (or at least that I can think of): bikes, towels, shampoo, conditioner, shower cap, different maps, guides etc. and he will always be of service when information or recommendations are needed. Daniel is very easy to deal with and it was a pleasure to stay with him.\\r<br/>Thank you Daniel.\",\n",

Early on, he e-mailed very explicit directions on how to reach his home and upon reaching there, he had maps and travel guides handy and was available to answer any questions. The room was quiet, comfortable, and meticulous. His place is a bit out of the central area of Amsterdam, but is easily accessible by tram. It was also nice to be away from the crowds and in a local neighborhood. We would thoroughly recommend his place and would stay again when in the area!\",\n",
       " 'Daniel was an excellent host, and I whole heartedly recommend his accomodations.

He helped me figure out all my public transportation needs, weather predictions and requests.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>His place is clean and near lots of different tram lines, so you can get pretty much anywhere.  Also he seems to work around your schedule in terms of cleaning the room and letting you use the shower, etc.  So it's just really comfortable in that regard where you don't feel like you are imposing too much.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>There are also some food options around his apartment to grab some food late at night which is always handy.  Would definitely stay there agin.\",\n",

Daniel also provides a private kettel, a range of tea and coffee. There are also towels for which Daniel provides a special space in the bathroom. \\r<br/>What was outstanding, was that Daniel also lent us two of his bikes.

Daniel's is really, really nice - but it IS European. If you're fresh off the plane from North America and have never been to Europe before I'd suggest you get a hotel for a few days first. But I'd say that about any European apartment. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Hugely enjoyed my time. Highly recommend.  \",\n",

He was a wealth of information in terms of when to go to certain museums, what was and wasn't worthwhile, and the best ways to get around using public transportation. He even allowed us to use his bikes free of charge! He was very accommodating and accepted our booking very last minute, and didn't mind that we were arriving late in the evening on a weeknight.

It is well maintained, very clean, nicely decorated. The bed is really comfortable, the sheets are soft and fragrant. There were beautiful flowers, tea and hot water inside my room. He has an eye for everything, is friendly and very professional. Daniel arranged everything and advised me before the trip. His manager went well beyond to answer my daily questions, taught me how travel around the city, and was nearby most times or quickly responded to my messages.

He has a great place in a quiet neighboorhood with easy access to trams and busses to get to the centraal station in 15 mins. On our arrival he shared a lot of good information about places to visit. We had an extra guest at the last minute and he was more than happy to accommodate  him in the living room.

The garden view was so peaceful. Both my bf and myself were sick during our Europe trip and Daniel was kind enough to offer us lozenges for our sore throats. He was also very helpful by providing maps, magazines on things to do and any other advice we needed. The room came equipped with coffee and tea and WiFi. His home is very close to public transportation and getting to central Amsterdam was a breeze. If I ever come back to Amsterdam I would definitely be staying at his place again. \",\n",

At his home everything is perfectly organized and clean, the room is nice, cozy, comfortably, quiet and is located in a nice neighboorhood and very well connected.

On getting there he gave me directions on how best to get to do what I wanted in the time I had.  He provided privacy though I knew he was there to provide any help he could if needed.  I would recommend his place to my friends.  His place is in a very convenient and safe area.  I would definitely look into his place if I had another chance to go to Amsterdam. Thanks, Daniel.\",\n",

Our only complaint was that we were not made aware of the early morning check out time upon arrival and came home the night before to a note on the door asking us to be out by a certain time. As long as you get all the information and communication from him, you should be fine.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>\",\n",

Only slight problem we faced was a space issue when opening up multiple suitcases in the same room, but we got used to it soon enough. The room also has a mini-refrigerator - which was of great convenience. The neighborhood this apartment is located in is also very nice. Overall, very comfortable stay!\",\n",

Besides, there is a table and a small fridge. The shower (separate from the WC)  is also very good. The apartment is not in the center but you can easily reach it by bus, tram or metro. There are various restaurants, bars and cafés in the area - this is great because you get to know places where tourists usually do not go. \\r<br/>Daniel is a great host, he provided us with very useful info about transport and things to do in Ams. Our stay was great, we did not have any problem at all in the apartment. I am sure Daniel would provide any further assistance that we may have needed, he really thinks about every tiny thing a tourist may need during his/her stay in Amsterdam. I also wanted to thank him for finding the contact lenses we forgot in the bedroom! Definitely recommend! \",\n",

He went above and beyond our expectations when he was able to arrange his schedule to accept my friend's late baggage while we were enjoying the city.  I would recommend Daniel's place to everyone ! It is so close to the city center and the place is incredibly clean and comfortable! I wish we were there longer and I hope to return some day! \",\n",
       " \"Not sure what else can be said about Daniel.  He is a true gentleman and was always ready with any answers (or bandaids) we needed!

If we ever make it back to Amsterdam I won't even bother looking for somewhere else to stay!\",\n",
       " 'My experience in amsterdam was brilliant. From daniels appartment i had close access to buses and/or trams, so getting to the city centre was easy. A simple 5 minute journey.  Daniel as a host was superb, very relaxed atmosphere in his home, and he provided us with lots of information including places to go/see. I recommend daniel as a host full heartedly.  Brilliant time. Til next time!',\n",
       " \"Daniel was a very helpful host. Upon arrival he was there to welcome us with cold drinks. He provided us with clear directions and maps of Amsterdam. He made it so easy to explore Amsterdam using public transport. He was always available and happy to answer question. He was friendly and talkative and interested in our days. He was very well organised and the apartment was as pictured and spotlessly clean. The bed were very comfortable. I bought some food without realising that guests don't have access to the kitchen (it is written in the room description), Daniel was very generous and still let me use his kitchen to cook my food. We had a little bit of trouble connecting to the internet in the bedroom (was strong in the lounge room) Daniel gave us a signal booster for the bedroom when we let him know. I would recommend staying with Daniel.\",\n",
       " \"After we arrived Daniel showed us the accommodations and offered us something to drink. We proceeded to talk for the better part of three hours. Daniel is one of the most agreeable and accommodating people I have stayed with through Airbnb. In his apartment are countless books about Amsterdam that one can leaf through. However, if you don't like to read, he can show you places to go and tell you about locales to visit that are not only interesting for tourists but for locals as well. He provides you with numerous maps, so you will never be wanting a reference if you happen to lose your way. It was a warm and informative welcome. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The accommodations were spectacular. There are ample nooks in which to store your baggage, so what at first appears to be a modestly-sized room for two people with luggage turns out to be rather spacious. The room is equipped with a water heater, instant coffee, and tea, so if the need for a morning pep-up settles upon you, it is right there in your room. Each bed is equipped with a reading lamp and the heater is placed nicely between the heads of the bed. We were never cold. The bathroom and toilet were kept impeccably clean and the towels were washed when we needed them. The orchids throughout the apartment were also very beautiful, and when we wanted some fresh air we needed only to open the window to the garden that is situated between the beds. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The location of the apartment should suit those who want quick access to the city center without the bustle and noise. If one wishes to go by foot, one can get to the many attractions old city in about 30-45 minutes, depending on how fast one walks. It is an enjoyable city to walk in: very flat, organized, neighborhood markets everyday, different languages and cultures always surrounding you. The apartment itself is in a primarily non-native-Dutch neighborhood, so you're exposed from the get-go to the nice mix of cultures that Amsterdam harbors. The area is quiet but active. Staying here, one also experiences the everyday life of Amsterdam and avoids an environment overly saturated with tourists. There is a school, many shops for locals, and a playground for children in the vicinity. Flevo Park is about a five-minute walk from the apartment, which is nice if you want to spend an afternoon among the storks, swans, and sandy soil upon which Amsterdam is rooted.  \\r<br/>\\r<br/>To the host himself: Daniel is helpful. He makes sure you are comfortable and is always open to questions and offering suggestions. He takes care of without meddling over you. You could talk to him not only about Amsterdam but many things: the art in his apartment, the furniture, films, etc. We had no complaints and were very happy to have stayed there. If you wish to visit Amsterdam but avoid the bustle, this is where you should stay.\",\n",
       " \"Daniel was a great host, very attentive and prudent. His appartement was just as shown in the photos, very homely and clean and it smelled very nice and fresh. Hence we really enjoyed staying with him. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>After booking he sent us a nice email with lots of information and responded quickly to our questions.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>When we arrived in Amsterdam, we got a phone call from Daniel making sure we found his place okay. He is a calm, very friendly person who is fluent in English. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Upon arriving in Niasstraat, Anna and I realised that we didn’t know his last name, so we were worried, if we’d find his doorbell. To our surprise, he put his first name on the doorbell which is smart and gives him the benefit of a little more anonymity. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>We were greeted by Daniel at the door who invited us in and offered us something to drink. We were sitting in his living room, which is decorated with African wooden figures, listening to the Pachelbel canon. \\r<br/>He gave us lots of valuable information, including various maps (public transport, of the neighborhood and whole city), aswell as bus and tram schedules. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>You could tell from every detail that Daniel handles his hosting very professionally: he has a door lock with a key code, which he individually changes for every guest. His WiFi passwort was also changed specifically for our stay. We were positively surprised! \\r<br/>For security reasons, he also installed an infrared webcam in his hallway, which is okay but he forgot to mention it.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>After that he gave us the tour of his appartement. It’s a cozy, very tidy place with a guest room looking at the garden.\\r<br/>There are two beds, on top of each layed two rolled-up towels. They were color-marked red and orange respectively, so we would not confuse them in the bathroom. Another smart detail. \\r<br/>The room had all the extras as described and seen in the photographs. Daniel cleaned the dishes for us after every time we made tea and also cleaned our waste basket every day. \\r<br/>WiFi reception was not the best in the bedroom (we used two Android smartphones). Enough for WhatsApp, but not enough for watching YouTube clips. A WiFi repeater in the room would be a good solution to this problem. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>After this he showed us the bathroom. I was amused by a small homo-erotic piece of art attached to the bathroom door. The bathroom, like the rest of the appartment, was very clean, with a nice shower, space for toiletries on the washing machine and color-marked towel bars. The toilet was not in the bathroom, but an own seperate room.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>We can highly recommend @Daniel's and if we'll be visting Amsterdam again we would try to stay with him again.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Hartstikke bedankt Daniel!\",\n",

It's difficult to get used to if you don't bike everyday, but it was so much fun! And Daniel told us everything we needed to know about biking in he city!
